# Harmonic Mixing Helper ðŸŽ¶

A tiny Python script that helps DJs use the **Camelot Wheel** for harmonic mixing.  
Given a musical key (e.g. `Am`, `C#m`, `Bb`, `G`), the script outputs all keys that are harmonically compatible according to standard rules.

---

## Features
- Converts normal musical keys to **Camelot notation** (e.g. `Am` â†’ `8A`)
- Suggests safe mixing options:
  - Same key
  - Adjacent keys (Â±1 step on the Camelot Wheel)
  - Major â†” Minor flip (same number, A â†” B)
